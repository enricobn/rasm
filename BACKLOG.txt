- split the standard library
  - the include files should be searched relative to actual folder / stdlib folder, plus the current folder, and it can
    be overridden with an environment var with a list of folders, separated by colon
  - add a new keyword architecture "", for example "i386", to include the subsequent code only if the architecture matches,
    or add a second parameter to include for specifying the architecture, so for example include "asm386.rasm", "i386"
  - the folder structure of the stdlib folder should be:
      - io/
        - io.rasm without asm and include "io_i386.rasm" (I would like to do it depending on the backend)
        - io_i386.rasm
      - mem/
        - mem.rasm without asm and include "io_i386.rasm" (I would like to do it depending on the backend)
        - mem_i386.rams
      - list.rams
      - option.rasm
      - std.rams
        - include all the others
        - other functions
- delete asm, object and executable file on compile
- write "and", "or", "not" function in asm inline
- I think include messes up reporting error line
- error if there's a function named the same way as a lambda parameter
- support for boolean
- optimize the copy of the parent lambda space: do not create parameters that are overridden by parent memcopy
- test inner lambda that get a value from a parent lambda parameter
- optimize memory for lambda space:
  - if there are more lambda in a call, all share the same lambda space (but not the address to the function), now it's duplicated:
    - I can create only one lambda space, then I can pass to the lambda, the address to the real function and the address to the lambda space
- rename asm to native
- user should not define native functions
- some functions from the std library should not be called (tag with internal?), for example malloc, memcopy
- optimize fibonacci
    - backend for 32 and 64 bit
    - move more code as possible from codegen to function_call_parameters
- refactor codegen lambda parameters: it's too complex
- I would like to have some namespace for functions, to be xx.yy.zz::function_name
- I can close an already closed TokensGroup (make a test)
- safe command line arguments (use Option?)
- add command line argument to print the syntax tree (codegen/md.rs -> Parser::print(&self.module))
- rename lambda to closure?
- line errors in codegen
- type checker
- UTF-8 strings

BUGS
-----
- "fn listMap<T("    should not be valid because the angle bracket is not closed, but now it works, but probably the type parameters are gone...
  - look at param_types_matcher
- a fn with an asm block /{ }/ is interpreted as asm
- error when a parameter of an asm function starts the same as another : v v1
    - we must process them in size order descending
- error when an enum variant starts the same as another : T T1
