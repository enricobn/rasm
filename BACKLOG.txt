- private functions
- optimize
  - can a recursive function's lambda space be reused?
- Vec
  - vecFilter and vecFoldL dereference
  - vecFilter shrink (add a shrink function that shrinks allocated memory)
- allocator
  - check for size >= allocated and use shrink
  - try to pack consecutive free "slots"
- move all asm code to backend
- TextMacro:
    - is it possible to use TextMacro in standard functions? (but for what?)
    - is it possible to inline the functions called with TextMacro?
- game of life: if we don't pass a number, it should run until no cells are alive
- type check
  - use Result
- rename "parametric type" to "generic type" all over the place
- libraries
  - the include files should be searched relative to "current folder"/"stdlib folder", plus the current folder, and it can
    be overridden with an environment var with a list of folders, separated by colon
  - ??? add a new keyword architecture "", for example "i386", to include the subsequent code only if the architecture matches,
    or add a second parameter to include for specifying the architecture, so for example include "asm386.rasm", "i386"
- delete asm, object and executable file before compile
- I think include messes up reporting error line (probably it has been fixed, check it)
- error if there's a function named the same way as a lambda parameter (or give precedence to parameter?)
- optimize the copy of the parent lambda space: do not create parameters that are overridden by parent memcopy
- test inner lambda that get a value from a parent lambda parameter
- optimize memory for lambda space:
  - if there are more lambda in a call, all share the same lambda space (but not the address to the function), now it's duplicated:
    - I can create only one lambda space, then I can pass, the address to the real function and the address to the lambda space, to the lambda,
      or a single pointer to a "structure" where the first word is the pointer to the function and the second the pointer to the lambda space
- rename asm to native
- user should not define native functions?
- some functions from the std library should not be called (tag with internal?), for example malloc, memcopy
- optimize fibonacci
    - backend for 32 and 64 bit
    - move more code as possible from codegen to function_call_parameters
- refactor codegen lambda parameters: it's too complex
- I would like to have some namespace for functions, to be xx.yy.zz::function_name
- I can close an already closed TokensGroup (make a test)
- safe command line arguments (use Option?)
- add command line arguments to the compiler:
  - to print the syntax tree
  - to print memory allocation
  - to debug asm
  - to run the program
- rename lambda to closure?
- line errors in codegen
- threads
