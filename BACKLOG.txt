Doing
------
- enum
- optimizing inline for fibonacci
    - backend for 32 and 64 bit
    - move more code as possible from codegen to function_call_parameters

Next
-----
- I can close an already closed TokensGroup (make a test)
- safe command line arguments (we need Option)
- add command line argument to print the syntax tree (codegen/md.rs -> Parser::print(&self.module))
